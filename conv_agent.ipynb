It's like theyâ€™re trying to unlock a relationship achievement, but their fear is like a glitch in the system. And don't even get me started on those who ghost you after the first date, like they're playing some extreme version of hide and seek. Henry, I just want to say, if you don't like me, just tell me. I can handle rejection, I can't handle the mystery of why you suddenly disappeared!\n",

They look all shiny and perfect in the picture, but when you actually meet them in person, you realize there are a few dents and scratches you didn't notice before. Sometimes you just have to be grateful if the engine still runs smoothly, you know what I mean?\n",

      "\n",
      "But hey, despite all the ups and downs of dating, I'm still optimistic. After all, they say laughter is the best medicine, so maybe if we all keep laughing, we'll find our happily ever afters... or at least a decent Netflix buddy. Thank you, Henry!\n",

And you're absolutely right - even if things don't work out, at least we'll have some hilarious stories to share with our friends. Who knows, maybe one day we'll look back on all these mishaps and realize they were just stepping stones to finding the real deal.
