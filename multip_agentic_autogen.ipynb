      "\n",
      "But seriously, have you ever noticed that no matter how late you are for work, there's always time for a coffee? Like, you could be running 10 minutes late, but you're still in line at Starbucks like, \"Yeah, I'll take a venti, please!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And don't you just love it when you're at a family gathering and someone says, \"You've really filled out since the last time I saw you!\" Yeah, thanks Aunt Karen, I've been stress eating ever since you arrived!\n",
      "\n",
      "But hey, being here tonight is like therapy for me. Which is great, because if I actually went to therapy, my therapist would probably be like, \"And how does that make you feel?\" And I'd be like, \"It makes me feel like I need a refund!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "You know what's funny to me? Self-checkout machines. I feel like they always have an attitude, like they're silently judging you as you struggle to scan that avocado. And then when you finally figure it out, they hit you with that \"Unexpected item in bagging area\" like, excuse me, I'm the one who's here trying to figure out how to use you!\n",
      "\n",
      "And have you ever noticed how when you're on hold with customer service, they always say, \"Your call is important to us\"? Really? Because it doesn't feel that way when I've been listening to elevator music for the past 20 minutes!\n",
      "\n",
      "But you know what's truly a mystery to me? Why do we park on driveways and drive on parkways? I mean, who came up with that? Were they just like, \"Hey, let's switch things up and confuse people for fun!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "And speaking of adulthood, it's funny how our idea of a good time changes as we get older. Remember when staying up late meant partying all night? Now, staying up late just means we're watching another episode of that show we're binge-watching on Netflix!\n",
      "\n",
      "And let's talk about technology for a minute. Have you ever noticed how your phone dies just as you're about to win that level in a game or send a really important text? It's like a conspiracy with the universe to keep us constantly plugged in!\n",

      "\n",
      "And speaking of jobs, I recently saw a sign that said, \"Now hiring, must have experience.\" Like, how am I supposed to get experience if you won't hire me to get experience? It's like a Catch-22 of the job market!\n",
